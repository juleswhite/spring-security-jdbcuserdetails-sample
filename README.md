# Getting Started

### Overview

This project shows a minimal example of using Spring's built-in JdbcUserDetailsManager 
to manage users. The example provides an AccountController that can be used to add a
user from an account with the ADMIN role. On startup, the application generates an
"admin" and "user" account with random passwords to access the system. 

This is a very simple example that shows how to set up users with the JdbcUserDetailsManager
int both the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and externally from your own custom controller.
Many of the examples that use the JdbcUserDetailsManager only show how to create users
in the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and not from a separate controller that you create.
